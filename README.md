# Trade-Ahead-Project
● The stock market has consistently proven to be a good place to invest in and save for the future.  Investing in stocks can help in fighting inflation, create wealth, and also provides some tax benefits.  Good steady returns on investments over a long period of time can also grow a lot more than seems  possible. Overall, investing in stocks can help meet life's financial aspirations. ● It is important to maintain a diversified portfolio when investing in stocks as it tends to yield higher  returns and reduces risk by tempering potential losses when the market is down. Trade&amp;Ahead is a  financial consultancy firm that wants to conduct a cluster analysis on their stock data as it can help  identify stocks that exhibit similar characteristics and ones that exhibit minimum correlation, and  consequently, maximize earnings under any market condition. ● They have provided data comprising stock price and some financial indicators for a few companies  listed under the New York Stock Exchange. The task at hand is to analyze the data, group the stocks  based on the attributes provided, and share insights about the characteristics of each group.
